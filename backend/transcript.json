(T: Mhm, mhm) And uh one of the things that bothers me the most is especially men, and having men to the house and how it affects the children (T: Mhm, Mhm) and- Uh, the biggest thing I want - the thing that keeps coming to my mind I want to tell you about is that I have a daughter, nine, who at one time I felt had a lot of emotional problems. I wish I could stop shaking (T and C: laugh). And uh, I'm real conscious of things affecting her. I don't want her to get upset, I don't want to shock her. I want so bad to- for her to accept me. And we're real open with each other especially about sex. And the other day she saw a girl that was single but pregnant and she asked me all about 'can girls get pregnant if they are single?'"

(T: Mhm, Mhm, Mhm) I don't begin to know where to go. I thought that I had pretty well worked over most of my guilt, and now that this is coming up I'm disappointed in myself. (T: Mhm, Mhm) I really am. I want- I like it when I feel that no matter what I do, even if it's against my mother's morals or my upbringing, that I can still feel okay about me. And now I don't. Uh, there's a part of me that who sort of mother me. And now I don't.  Like uh, there's a girl at work who sort of mothers. me and she just- she- I think she thinks I'm all sweet, and I sure don't want to show my more ornery devilish side with her.  I want to be sweet and it's so hard for me to - this all seems so new again (T: Mhm) and it's so disappointing."

(T: Mhm) Like uh, I want to be a good mother so bad, and I feel like I am a good mother, (T: Mhm) but then there’s those little exceptions. Like my guilts with working. I want to work and it’s so fun having extra money. I like to work nights. The minute I think I’m not being real good to the children or giving them enough time, then I start feeling guilty again. Then, that’s when I- it’s uh- what do they call it? (Looks away briefly.) A double bind. That’s just what it feels like. I want to do this and it feels right, but after all I’m not being a good mother and I want to be both. I am becoming more and more aware of what a perfectionist I am. That is what it seems I want to be so perfect. Either I want to become perfect in my standards, or not have that need any more."

If I really fell in love with a man and I respected him and I adored him, I don’t think I would feel so guilty about sex. And I don’t know why I would want to make up any excuses to why this is true. (T: Mhm, Mhm) I really am. I want- I like it when I feel that no matter when I have the physical desires and I’ll say, 'Oh well, why not,' and I want to anyway, but I feel guilty afterwards. I hate facing the kids, I don’t like looking at myself, and I rarely enjoy it. And this is what I mean. If the circumstances would be different, I don’t think I’d feel so guilty because I’d feel right about it. (Gestures more profoundly.)"

I tried that also. I’ve tried saying, 'O.K., I don’t like myself when I do that so I won’t do it any more.' But then I resent the children. I think, why should they stop me from doing what I want, and it is really not that bad."

I just let go and I have- there’s too many things I do wrong that I have to feel guilty for, and I sure don’t like that. I want you very much to give me a direct answer, and I’m going to ask it, and I don’t expect a direct answer, (Smiles.) but I want to know. Do you feel that - to me the most important thing is to be open and honest and if I can be open and honest with my children, do you feel that it could harm them?  If for example, I could say to Pammy, \"I was- I felt bad lying to you, Pammy, and I want to tell you the truth now,\" and if I tell her the truth and she’s shocked at me and she’s upset, that that could bother her more?  I was- I want to get rid of my guilts and that will help me, but I don't want to put ‘em on her."
