I wish I could stop shaking (T and C: laugh). And uh, I'm real conscious of things affecting her. I don't want her to get upset, I don't want to shock her. I want so bad to- for her to accept me.

And I don't want to lie to Pammy either and I don't know...\nTherapist: I sure wish I could give you the answer as to what you should tell her. (Smiles.)\nPatient: I was afraid you were going to say that (Laughs).\nTherapist: Because what you really want is an answer.\nPatient: I want to especially know if it would affect her if I was completely honest and open with her or if it would affect her because I lied.

She probably wouldn't want to admit it to me because she thinks I'm so good and so sweet. (Points to herself.) And yet I'm afraid she could think I'm really a- a devil.
